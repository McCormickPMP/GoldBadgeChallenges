#Gold Badge
This is a readme file for my GitHub Gold Badge business challenges for my work at Eleven Fifty Academy.
This work was done in the first 4 weeks of my work in the .net Framework Boot Camp.  
This work highlights my introduction to C#, using Visual Studio Community and the .NET Framework.
