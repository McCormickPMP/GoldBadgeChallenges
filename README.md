Gold Badge

This is a readme file for my GitHub Gold Badge business challenges at Eleven Fifty Academy.
This work was done in the first 4 weeks of my work in the .NET Framework Boot Camp.  
This work highlights my introduction to C#, using Visual Studio Community and the .NET Framework.

Challenge 1: Cafe Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.</p>
Challenge 2: Komodo Insurance has a bug in its software and needs some new code.</p>  
Challenge 3: Komodo needs an app that maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information.</p>

How to Use</p>
When I first started my repository I mistakenly put the Cafe assemblies without a leading 01_.  So, the Cafe assemblies are for Challenge 1,  Challenge 2 is correctly identified as 02_Claims, and Challenge 3 is correctly identified as 03_Badges.</p>
I used this as a learning opportunity for defining file structure and for learning a new technologies such as VS Community and GitHub.</p>
I reviewed several videos on how to rename assemblies in VS Community.  The best video I found is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZImkQ548vdg.</p>
This post on renaming was also very helpful.  https://gist.github.com/n3dst4/b932117f3453cc6c56be </p>
TLDR, an 11 step process for renaming solutions and projects.  DO NOT USE Visual Studio to do it!</p>
